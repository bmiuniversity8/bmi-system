/**
 * @bmi/shared — Institution Identity
 *
 * Single source of truth for the platform's dual identity.
 *
 * - LEGAL_NAME ("BEMI TRAINING INSTITUTE") is the REGISTERED business name.
 *   It MUST appear on every payment surface: Paystack dashboard business
 *   profile, checkout description, bank statement descriptor, invoices,
 *   receipts, and payment confirmation emails. This is what the student sees
 *   on their bank/card statement, so consistency here prevents chargebacks
 *   and "unknown merchant" support tickets.
 * - ACADEMIC_BRAND ("BMI University") is the public academic/trading brand
 *   used for teaching, admissions, LMS, and general communications.
 *
 * Harmonization rule: payment contexts always lead with the legal name and
 * qualify the academic brand as "trading as". Academic contexts lead with
 * the academic brand and reference the legal entity in footers/legal copy.
